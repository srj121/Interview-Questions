*TreeSet

1. A TreeSet is implemented as a self-balancing binary search tree, specifically a red-black tree.
2. The red-black tree is a type of binary search tree that balances its height to ensure fast access and efficient updates.
3. In a red-black tree, each node has a color - red or black - and the tree is balanced such that no two red nodes are adjacent,
4. and the black height (the number of black nodes along any path from the root to a leaf) is the same for all paths.
5. When an element is added to a TreeSet, it is inserted into the appropriate position in the red-black tree based on its natural ordering
6. The red-black tree then re-balances itself if necessary to maintain its balance properties.
7. When searching for an element in a TreeSet, the red-black tree is traversed in a manner similar to a binary search,
8. comparing the target element to the elements at each node and following the appropriate branch until the target is found or determined to be absent.
7. Similarly, when removing an element from a TreeSet, the element is located within the red-black tree and removed,
8. after which the tree is rebalanced if necessary to maintain its balance properties.
9. The internal workings of a TreeSet ensure that its operations have a time complexity of O(log n),
10.making it an efficient data structure for maintaining sorted sets of elements.

*TreeMap

1. A TreeMap is implemented as a self-balancing binary search tree, specifically a red-black tree.
2. The red-black tree is a type of binary search tree that balances its height to ensure fast access and efficient updates.
3. In a red-black tree, each node has a color - red or black - and the tree is balanced such that no two red nodes are adjacent,
4. and the black height (the number of black nodes along any path from the root to a leaf) is the same for all paths.
5. When an element is added to a TreeMap, it is inserted into the appropriate position in the red-black tree based on its key's natural ordering
6. The red-black tree then rebalances itself if necessary to maintain its balance properties.
7. When searching for an element in a TreeMap, the red-black tree is traversed in a manner similar to a binary search,
8. comparing the target key to the keys at each node and following the appropriate branch until the target is found or determined to be absent.
9. Similarly, when removing an element from a TreeMap, the element is located within the red-black tree and removed,
10. after which the tree is rebalanced if necessary to maintain its balance properties.
11. The internal workings of a TreeMap ensure that its operations have a time complexity of O(log n),
12. making it an efficient data structure for maintaining sorted maps of key-value pairs.
